This branch contains final version of the booklet
Feria V hebdomadae III
with changes that were requested by the director of the cathedral schola 
and which I cannot perform with the usual policies.

* all chants stripped of rhythmical signs
* canticle text not corresponding with the Liturgia horarum, editio typica 1975 (the text in used is said to be in recent monastic chant books, but I haven't seen these and they aren't valid liturgical books for us non-monastics...)
* one melody tweak according to recent Antiphonale Monasticum II from Solesmes which I haven't seen - the schola director only sent me solfege transcriptions
