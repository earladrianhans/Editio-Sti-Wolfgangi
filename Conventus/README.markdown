# Series Conventus #

Booklets prepared for the choir 
[Conventus Choralis](http://www.introitus.cz/). Each booklet
contains office (and not always mass) chants for an occasion in the 
liturgical year, usually a solemnity or Sunday, according to the
Antiphonale Monasticum 1933.

As Conventus Choralis is sort of an offspring of 
[Choeur gregorien de Paris](http://www.choeur-gregorien-de-paris.asso.fr/), 
the booklets follow established informal
standards of office booklets of the latter ensemble.

To compile the booklet, look in the respective directory.
* if you find a Rakefile, run 'rake'
* if you find a 'hiram.yml', run 'ruby ../../instrumenta/hiram.rb'
